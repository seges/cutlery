You can have more ambassadors running at once if you specify different names.\r\n\r\nIf you need to connect two services, e.g. web to database, you need an ambassador container running and:\r\n\r\n* database containing environment variable ```SERVICE_NAME``` or ```SERVICE_<exposed port>_NAME``` definitions in order to register it in Consul, e.g. ```SERVICE_5555_NAME=db``` and publishing port ```-p 5555``` (there is no need to specify exact port)\r\n* web containing environment variable ```BACKEND_<local port>```, e.g. ```BACKEND_5432=db.service.consul``` and link to ambassador - ```--link=\"ambassador:backends\"```\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, you point all database connections within web container to ```backends:5432``` and Ambassador container ensures proxying of the request to database container with proper port resolution, because it discovers it from Consul service entry for ```db.service.consul``` - the IP and port. Thus you don't need to explicitly bind ports to host and keep the scalability at maximum level.\r\n\r\nLink alias ```backends``` is automatically added to container's ```/etc/hosts``` with the IP of Ambassador to handle the proxying.\r\n\r\n## Discovery\r\n\r\n```\r\ncutlery discovery\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrepares Consul with Registrator to support Docker service discovery. \r\n\r\nIt has possibility to register DNSmasq entry to redirect all requests from host pointing to 'service.consul' domain to running Consul.\r\n\r\nIf you want to start service discovery on the host with public IP 10.20.30.40 which is standalone (e.g. your development environment), execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncutlery discovery start \"-advertise 10.20.30.40 -bootstrap\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can provide usual Consul arguments and they will be passed to the container upon startup.\r\n\r\nEvery container containing ```SERVICE_NAME``` or ```SERVICE_<exposed port>_NAME``` environment variables will be registered in Consul by Progrium's Registrator.\r\n\r\n### Host DNS resolution\r\n\r\nThere are situations (especially in development) when you want to access services from host which are registered in Consul by their appropriate DNS names (e.g. ```db.service.consul```). You have the possibility to add an entry into your host's ```/etc/hosts``` file but that is cumbersome and might contain stale data after some time. In case you are using NetworkManager, Cutlery can register route to DNSmasq to resolve all ```service.consul``` domain names to Consul container.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncutlery discovery register\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe command restarts networking in order to be applied.\r\n\r\n## Global DNS\r\n\r\n```\r\ncutlery global-dns\r\n```\r\n\r\nSets default DNS for Docker containers on the host.\r\n\r\n(!) *Beware it restarts Docker*\r\n\r\nSo for example if you want to register default DNS for containers that will be published on Docker's bridge IP, you execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncutlery global-dns docker0\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-569687-27","note":"Don't delete this file!
